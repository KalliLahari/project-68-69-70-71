It is a warm, friendly space where students are provided with healthy and balanced meals that are both nutritious and appetizing. Our chefs prepare everything from scratch, whether it’s a salad dressing or freshly baked bread.
Students have a wide variety of hot and cold food with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and salads at meal times. The school also caters to different diets, including food allergies and vegetarians.

Infants recognise the melody of a song long before they understand the words. Toddlers enjoy dancing and grooving to music. Teenagers are known to use musical experiences to create friendships and to carve out a space for themselves which sets them apart from others.
Our students learn about musical techniques in greater depth through classes that touch upon subjects such as composition, music technology, jazz improvisation and music theory.</p>
